In order to run this project there are three main files.

1. ScannerImplementation_A1.jflex
2. test.text
3. script.sh

The .java files and the .class are generated automatically. When the script is ran.

To execute the script,  run this command inside the directory.

sh ./script.sh

The script is going to pass the test file automatically into the compiled java class and generate an output.txt file.
